# Credit_Card_Defaults

The project within this repo is from a group project, completed as a part of a Master's in Data Science. 

Credit card defaults can have a significant impact on a lender's financial performance. 
When a credit card borrower defaults on their payments, the lender may not be able to recover the full amount owed, which can result in a loss. 
By predicting credit card defaults, lenders can take proactive measures to minimize their risk and potentially avoid losses.

Predicting credit card defaults can help lenders identify customers who may be at higher risk of defaulting, so they can take steps to mitigate that risk. 
For example, a lender may offer a customer with a high risk of defaulting a lower credit limit, a higher interest rate, or other risk-mitigating measures to reduce the likelihood of default.
Additionally, predicting credit card defaults can help lenders improve their credit risk management practices overall. 
By identifying patterns and trends in credit card default data, lenders can refine their underwriting and lending practices to better assess and manage risk.
